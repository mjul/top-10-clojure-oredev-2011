# Top Ten Things to Learn From Clojure That Will Make You a Better Developer in Any Language

Presentation for Ã˜redev 2011 by Martin Jul.

## Abstract

Clojure is an exciting new language for the Java and .NET platforms.  

It is a modern Lisp featuring dynamic meta-programming, transactional memory and cool concurrency concepts that are well suited for the multi-core reality of today. 

This talk will present some of its key concepts and innovations: 

You will learn how immutability and persistent collections vastly simplify state management. We will explore its concurrency model with Software Transactional Memory. You wil see how Clojure provides a powerful yet simple programming model by separating out the concerns from the OO class concept. Finally, we will see how its meta-programming features enable us to turn Clojure into just the language you need for your application.

### Intended audience:
No Clojure background required.


## Producing the Syntax Highlighted Code Examples
The project uses the Marginalia tools to produce HTML documentation from the sources.
Run `cake marg src test` to build the documentation that is needed for the presentation.
